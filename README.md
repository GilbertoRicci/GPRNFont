# GPRNFont
**Unity Custom Font .fontsettings Generator**

Made during covid-19 quarantine, just for fun.

**Create Custom Fonts for Unity without have to fill manually data like "Vert X" or "UV Width". With GPRNFont, you can do it visually using an image.**

Instead of:
1. Create material
2. Assign font image file to material
3. Assign material to font
4. **Go to "Character rects" in font properties and set info manually each per letter (EXTREMELY BORING)**

With GPRNFont, you can:
1. Create material
2. Assign font image file to material
3. Assign material to font
4. Open font image file on GPRNFont
5. **Set characters visually using GPRNFont tools (KINDA FUN)**
6. Export data to .fontsettings file on Unity project
